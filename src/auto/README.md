# Auto-Generated Code Directory

This directory contains auto-generated game classes created by the aiFeatureBuilder.js script. These classes are automatically integrated into the game loop.

## Structure

Files in this directory are generated based on AI prompts and follow the game's architecture patterns. Each class typically:

1. Implements the GameObject interface
2. Has update and render methods
3. Uses animations from the SpriteLibrary
4. Provides specific game functionality

## Usage

Do not modify files in this directory directly, as they may be regenerated by the AI. Instead:

1. Use the aiFeatureBuilder.js script to create new components
2. If modifications are needed, copy the file to the appropriate directory first

## Example

```typescript
// Example auto-generated class
import { SpriteLibrary } from "../game/SpriteLibrary";
import { Character } from "../types/game";

export class GeneratedObject {
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  
  constructor(options: { x: number; y: number }) {
    this.position = options;
    // Initialization
  }
  
  update(dt: number) {
    // Update logic
  }
  
  render() {
    // Rendering logic
  }
}
```
