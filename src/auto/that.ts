Let's go ahead and create the basic structure for the game class that fulfills the specified requirements for our dungeon crawler game. The class will follow the hero, animate using a sprite library, and spawn within the game loop.

The code below is a TypeScript example, and I am making an assumption about what `SpriteLibrary` looks like since we haven't been given a specific implementation. We'll need to adapt it to your specific game engine or sprite library.

```typescript
// Import required types and functions.
import { Sprite, Animation, loadSpriteLibrary } from "./SpriteLibrary"; // Adjust this path as needed.

// Interface for the hero's position, assuming we can get its x and y coordinates.
interface Position {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

// Interface for the hero, assuming we have some basic functions to interact with.
interface Hero {
  getPosition: () => Position;
  // Other necessary hero methods.
}

// Game class that will handle tracking the hero, animation, and spawning.
export class Game {
  private hero: Hero;
  private heroSprite?: Sprite; // The hero's animated sprite.
  private gameLoopId?: number; // Used to manage the game loop.

  // Constructor takes a hero reference.
  constructor(hero: Hero) {
    this.hero = hero;
    this.initialize();
  }

  // Initial setup for the game.
  private async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Load sprite library and create hero sprite.
    const spriteLibrary = await loadSpriteLibrary(); // Make sure to substitute this with the actual sprite loading function.
    this.heroSprite = spriteLibrary.createSprite("hero"); // We'll need a corresponding 'hero' sprite in the library.
    this.startGameLoop();
  }

  // Starts the game loop.
  private startGameLoop(): void {
    this.gameLoopId = window.setInterval(this.gameLoop.bind(this), 1000 / 60); // 60 FPS game loop (can be adjusted as needed).
  }

  // The game loop function, called every frame.
  private gameLoop(): void {
    this.updateHeroPosition();
    this.render();
  }

  // Update the hero's position based on the hero reference.
  private updateHeroPosition(): void {
    if (this.heroSprite) {
      const position = this.hero.getPosition();
      this.heroSprite.position.x = position.x;
      this.heroSprite.position.y = position.y;
    }
  }

  // Render the game state, including the hero sprite.
  private render(): void {
    if (this.heroSprite) {
      this.heroSprite.update(); // Call the sprite's update method to handle animation.
      this.heroSprite.draw(); // Draw the sprite on the canvas.
    }
  }

  // Call this method to properly stop the game loop.
  public stopGameLoop(): void {
    if (this.gameLoopId) {
      clearInterval(this.gameLoopId);
      this.gameLoopId = undefined;
    }
  }
}
// Usage:
// (Assuming we have a `hero` with the necessary interface)
// const game = new Game(hero);
```

Please note that the implementation details of `SpriteLibrary`, `Sprite`, `Hero`, and any rendering context are assumed to fit a general pattern. You'll need to tailor the code to fit your actual sprite library and game environment. Adjust function and interface names, library loading methods, and rendering code to match your specific framework and architecture.
