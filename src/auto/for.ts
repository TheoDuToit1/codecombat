Sure! Below is a TypeScript example of how you might create a `Game` class for a dungeon crawler. This class will follow the hero, make use of a `SpriteLibrary` for animations, and spawn the hero within the game loop.

First, let's assume that you actually have a `Hero` class and a `SpriteLibrary` class with their respective methods and properties. You'll want to import these before creating the `Game` class. Since I don't have the actual implementation of these classes, I'm going to assume very basic structures for them.

```typescript
// Assuming that there is a file called Hero.ts
import { Hero } from './Hero';
// Assuming that there is a file called SpriteLibrary.ts
import { SpriteLibrary } from './SpriteLibrary';

export class Game {
  private loopHandle: number; // To keep track of the game loop interval
  private hero: Hero;
  private spriteLibrary: SpriteLibrary;

  constructor(hero: Hero, spriteLibrary: SpriteLibrary) {
    this.hero = hero;
    this.spriteLibrary = spriteLibrary;
    this.loopHandle = 0; // Indicates that the loop isn't running initially
  }

  public start(): void {
    this.loopHandle = window.requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoop());
  }

  public stop(): void {
    window.cancelAnimationFrame(this.loopHandle);
  }

  private gameLoop(): void {
    this.update();
    this.render();
    // Re-register for the next frame
    this.loopHandle = window.requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoop());
  }

  private update(): void {
    // Your game logic to update the hero's state

    // Let's say you have an update method on the hero
    this.hero.update();

    // Update other game elements as needed
  }

  private render(): void {
    // Clear the screen before redrawing

    // Let the sprite library handle hero animation rendering
    this.spriteLibrary.drawSprite(this.hero.spriteName, this.hero.position);

    // Draw other elements on the screen
  }
}
```

You would then create instances of `Hero` and `SpriteLibrary`, and instantiate your game with them. Call `start()` method to begin the game loop.

The `SpriteLibrary` is assumed to have a method `drawSprite()` which knows how to render specific sprites based on a sprite name and a position, which you would have provided as an attribute for the `Hero`.

The game loop uses the `requestAnimationFrame` which is a browser API for creating smooth animations by calling the provided callback function before the next repaint. `update()` contains the logic for updating the game state, and `render()` is responsible for drawing all the game's elements on the screen. 

With `stop()`, you can cancel the loop using the `cancelAnimationFrame()` function by passing the handle received from `requestAnimationFrame()`.

A more comprehensive example would require more specifics about how `Hero` and `SpriteLibrary` are implemented and detailed game mechanics and renderer code. This example just provides a high-level structure to get started with.
